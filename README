Inspire HEP - PURE MarcXML Mapping tool
=======================================
HEP_PURE_Mapping.php is a php script that uses curl to bring back MarcXML from http://inspirehep.net, and transforms it, using PHP XmlWriter,
into PURE-ready XML. The generated XML files can then be run into PURE using the Administator's Research Output import wizard.

All of the structure in the repo should be uploaded to your server.

In its current form, it is not particularly agile, in that it can only pass two parameters into the searching url:journal year and collaboration.
This means that it is good for loading a backlog of papers, but more work needs to be done to make it usable on a regular basis (unless running annually).
It can be run for individual papers too, using an ID.

We wrote the script to satisfy a requirement to load all authors for a collaboration, while matching those local to the
institution (in our case Edinburgh). The example files in the input folder show the correct format to do this matching.
Any matched authors will show as internal in the PURE application.

Similarly, there is the option of declaring the affiliated organisations for the authors. We make this optional, as we've found that
loading these can cause failures, as the PURE matching process is very resource-heavy. Loading without organisations works every time. If organisations are
to be matched, an optional orgs.txt can be uploaded, which means the importer is matching on an ID, not a string (it will work more slowly without this).

We default 5 papers to an XML file, but I have seen loads work with 20 or more, so that is a variable setting. The script download.php allows
the output to be returned in a zip file to the client user.

We report as much as possible back to the client user:
-If there is no Acceptance Date, it must be added manually.
-If there is no Published Date or any matched authors, the XML will not be produced for that paper.
-If there is no electronic version on SCOAP, again, it must be added manually.

STATUS
======
The code could be re-written to make it more modular- currently it is one long flow.
There is a quirk where two hard-coded names are escaped. There seems to be corrupt data in Inspire for these authors, and
I have been unable to fix it.
